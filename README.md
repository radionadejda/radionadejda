### Hi everyone
### I'm Nadejda and I'm another frontend developer.
Apparently one has to network these days, so here we go.  
![cat-computer](https://github.com/radionadejda/radionadejda/assets/131643073/39dcf551-11f0-481f-8960-fd27e50175bc)  

  I am good with HTML5 and CSS (do I even have to mention it?) and with sass as well.  
  I code in vanilla JavaScript.  
  I am currently studying React and Java.  
  I can also bootstrap my projects, but I don't have to.

While studuying, I did many practice projects alone, and also collaborated on several group projects, one of which I'm particularly proud of.
This is a website for [a non-profit initiative helping people with ASD](https://n3kr4s0v4.github.io/project_ASD/).  

I also particiapted in a hackathon, where over six hours our group created [an app for learning frontend basics](https://goncharovastacy.github.io/itgirlshackathon/) with flashcards and quiz. 

I'm a textbook introvert and I love to research whatever I don't know and to re-check whatever I'm not sure of.  
I used to be a lawyer and a wannabe rockstar, but I'm not anymore.  
My hobbies are knitting 🧶, learning languages 📚, petting my cats 🐈🐈‍⬛ and pondering 🤔.
